		<h1>LSCASM Documentation</h1>
		<p>LSCASM is a assembly langauge for LSCVM in CDDC 2019</p>
		<h2>LSC details</h2>
		<p>LSC has 3 different data regions, the code(rx), a stack(rw), and a heap(w)</p>
		<p>There is 2 printing instructions, one that prints a character and another that prints a signed integer</p>
		<p>There are instructions that can change the instruction pointer(ip), which allows jumping</p>
		<p>There is no registers, the stack is the only rw memory location</p>
		<p>There are basic push and pop operations along with some arithematic operations that operate on the top 2 elements of the stack. Some operation allows for arbituary read into the stack, although it pops the element and pushes it on top</p>
		<h2>LSCASM format</h2>
		<p>The format for instructions is <tt>inst arg1,arg2</tt></p>
		<p>Table of instructions:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>inst</th>
				<th>arg1</th>
				<td>arg2</th>
				<th>desc</th>
				<th>op code</th>
